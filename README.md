Project Name: YourJournal

YourJournal is a web application that allows the user to create, edit, keep, and view journals of their own.
Journals can vary according to user's need, e.g. notes, diary, etc.
It can also keep track of user's action histories, such as creating, editing, and deleting journals.
User can pin their favorite/important journals so that they will always be on top of the other journals.
User can view their particular journal in a customized tab.
Security is also in-mind; user must register with a password which must fulfill a number of requirements.
User can change their username and password anytime easily in the user tab.

YourJournal is very simple and user-friendly which is made so that everyone can simply understand and use.


YourJournal, journal made easier.
